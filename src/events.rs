//! Events we can monitor or count.
//!
//! There are three general categories of event:
//!
//! -   [`Hardware`] events are counted by the processor itself. This
//!     includes things like clock cycles, instructions retired, and cache and
//!     branch prediction statistics.
//!
//! -   [`Software`] events are counted by the kernel. This includes things
//!     like context switches, page faults, and so on.
//!
//! -   [`Cache`] events offer a more detailed view of the processor's cache
//!     counters. You can select which level of the cache hierarchy to observe,
//!     discriminate between data and instruction caches, and so on.
//!
//! The `Event` type is just an enum with a variant for each of the above types,
//! which all implement `Into<Event>`.
//!
//! Linux supports many more kinds of events than this module covers, including
//! events specific to particular make and model of processor, and events that
//! are dynamically registered by drivers and kernel modules. If something you
//! want is missing, think about the best API to expose it, and submit a pull
//! request!
