//! Direct, unsafe bindings for Linux [`perf_event_open`][man] and friends.
//!
//! Linux's `perf_event_open` system call provides access to the processor's
//! performance measurement counters (things like instructions retired, cache
//! misses, and so on), kernel counters (context switches, page faults), and
//! many other sources of performance information.
//!
//! You can't get the `perf_event_open` function from the `libc` crate, as you
//! would any other system call. The Linux standard C library does not provide a
//! binding for this function or its associated types and constants.
//!
//! Rust analogs to the C types and constants from `<linux/perf_event.h>` and
//! `<linux/hw_breakpoint.h>`, generated with `bindgen`, are available in the
//! [`bindings`] module.
//!
//! There are several ioctls for use with `perf_event_open` file descriptors;
//! see the [`ioctls`] module for those.
//!
//! For a safe and convenient interface to this functionality, see the
//! [`perf_event`] crate.
//!
//! ## Using the raw API
//!
//! As the kernel interface evolves, the struct and union types from the
//! [`bindings`] module may acquire new fields. To ensure that your code will
//! continue to compile against newer versions of this crate, you should
//! construct values of these types by calling their `Default` implementations,
//! which return zero-filled values, and then assigning to the fields you care
//! about. For example:
//!
//! ```
//! use perf_event_open_sys as sys;
//!
//! // Construct a zero-filled `perf_event_attr`.
//! let mut attrs = sys::bindings::perf_event_attr::default();
//!
//! // Populate the fields we need.
//! attrs.size = std::mem::size_of::<sys::bindings::perf_event_attr>() as u32;
//! attrs.type_ = sys::bindings::perf_type_id_PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE;
//! attrs.config = sys::bindings::perf_hw_id_PERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS as u64;
//! attrs.set_disabled(1);
//! attrs.set_exclude_kernel(1);
//! attrs.set_exclude_hv(1);
//!
//! // Make the system call.
//! let result = unsafe {
//!     sys::perf_event_open(&mut attrs, 0, -1, -1, 0)
//! };
//!
//! if result < 0 {
//!     // ... handle error
//! }
//!
//! // ... use `result` as a raw file descriptor
//! ```
//!
//! It is not necessary to adjust `size` to what the running kernel expects:
//! older kernels can accept newer `perf_event_attr` structs, and vice versa. As
//! long as the `size` field was properly initialized, an error result of
//! `E2BIG` indicates that the `attrs` structure has requested behavior the
//! kernel is too old to support.
//!
//! When `E2BIG` is returned, the kernel writes the size it expected back to the
//! `size` field of the `attrs` struct. Again, if you want to retry the call, it
//! is not necessary to adjust the size you pass to match what the kernel passed
//! back. The size from the kernel just indicates which version of the API the
//! kernel supports; see the documentation for the `PERF_EVENT_ATTR_SIZE_VER...`
//! constants for details.
//!
//! ## Kernel versions
//!
//! The bindings in this crate are generated from the Linux kernel headers
//! packaged by Fedora as `kernel-headers-5.18.4-200.fc36`, which
//! corresponds to `PERF_EVENT_ATTR_SIZE_VER7`.
//!
//! As explained above, bugs aside, it is not necessary to use the version of
//! these structures that matches the kernel you want to run under, so it should
//! always be acceptable to use the latest version of this crate, even if you
//! want to support older kernels.
//!
//! This crate's `README.md` file includes instructions on regenerating the
//! bindings from newer kernel headers. However, this can be a breaking change
//! for users that have not followed the advice above, so regeneration should
//! cause a major version increment.
//!
//! If you need features that are available only in a more recent version of the
//! types than this crate provides, please file an issue.
//!
//! ## Linux API Backward/Forward Compatibility Strategy
//!
//! (This is more detail than necessary if you just want to use the crate. I
//! want to write this down somewhere so that I have something to refer to when
//! I forget the details.)
//!
//! It is an important principle of Linux kernel development that new versions
//! of the kernel should not break userspace. If upgrading your kernel breaks a
//! user program, then that's a bug in the kernel. (This refers to the run-time
//! interface. I don't know what the stability rules are for the kernel headers:
//! can new headers cause old code to fail to compile? Anyway, run time is our
//! concern here.)
//!
//! But when you have an open-ended, complex system call like `perf_event_open`,
//! it's really important for the interface to be able to evolve. Certainly, old
//! programs must run properly on new kernels, but ideally, it should work the
//! other way, too: a program built against a newer version of the kernel
//! headers should run on an older kernel, as long as it only requests features
//! the old kernel actually supports. That is, simply compiling against newer
//! headers should not be disqualifying - only using those new headers to
//! request new features the running kernel can't provide should cause an error.
//!
//! Consider the specific case of passing a struct like `perf_event_attr` to a
//! system call like `perf_event_open`. In general, there are two versions of
//! the struct in play: the version the user program was compiled against, and
//! the version the running kernel was compiled against. How can we let old
//! programs call `perf_event_open` on new kernels, and vice versa?
//!
//! Linux has a neat strategy for making this work. There are four rules:
//!
//! -   Every system call that passes a struct to the kernel includes some
//!     indication of how large userspace thinks that struct is. For
//!     `perf_event_open`, it's the `size` field of the `perf_event_attr`
//!     struct. For `ioctl`s that pass a struct, it's a bitfield of the
//!     `request` value.
//!
//! -   Fields are never deleted from structs. At most, newer kernel headers may
//!     rename them to `__reserved_foo` or something like that, but once a field
//!     has been placed, its layout in the struct never changes.
//!
//! -   New fields are added to the end of structs.
//!
//! -   New fields' semantics are chosen such that filling them with zeros
//!     preserves the old behavior. That is, turning an old struct into a new
//!     struct by extending it with zero bytes should always give you a new
//!     struct with the same meaning as the old struct.
//!
//! Then, the kernel's strategy for receiving structs from userspace is as
//! follows (according to the comments for `copy_struct_from_user` in
//! the kernel source `include/linux/uaccess.h`):
//!
//! -   If the kernel's struct is larger than the one passed from userspace,
//!     then that means the kernel is newer than the userspace program. The
//!     kernel copies the userspace data into the initial bytes of its own
//!     struct, and zeros the remaining bytes. Since zeroed fields have no
//!     effect, the resulting struct properly reflects the user's intent.
//!
//! -   If the kernel's struct is smaller than the one passed from userspace,
//!     then that means that a userspace program compiled against newer kernel
//!     headers is running on an older kernel. The kernel checks that the excess
//!     bytes in the userspace struct are all zero; if they are not, the system
//!     call returns `E2BIG`, indicating that userspace has requested a feature
//!     the kernel doesn't support. If they are all zero, then the kernel
//!     initializes its own struct with the bytes from the start of the
//!     userspace struct, and drops the rest. Since the dropped bytes were all
//!     zero, they did not affect the requested behavior, and the resulting
//!     struct reflects the user's intent.
//!
//! -   In either case, the kernel verifies that any `__reserved_foo` fields in
//!     its own version of the struct are zero.
//!
//! This covers both the old-on-new and new-on-old cases, and returns an error
//! only when the call requests functionality the kernel doesn't support.
//!
//! You can find one example of using `perf_event_open` in the [`perf_event`]
//! crate, which provides a safe interface to a subset of `perf_event_open`'s
//! functionality.
//!
//! ## Using perf types on other platforms
//!
//! Although the functions in this crate are only available on Linux
//! and Android, the crate itself should build on Windows and Mac as
//! well. On those platforms, only the `bindings` module is available:
//! the types are useful to code that needs to parse perf data
//! produced on Linux.
